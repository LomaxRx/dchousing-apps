Prepare your own PDF
====================

If you obtain a PDF of a housing application, you can use it with
District Housing.

You'll need Acrobat Pro to edit form fields.  Peparing a PDF is mainly a
task of adding text input fields to the form, and naming those fields
correctly so we know how to fill it in.

Make fillable PDFs that work well
---------------------------------

There are a few tips you can use to make your new forms nicer.

### Fill the whole space with a single field box

Don't make text fields shorter than they have to be.  Try not to use two
boxes where one will do.  For example, in a field asking for the
applicant's name, use one input field called "Name", not two input
fields called "FirstName" and "LastName".

### Set the font size to 6 points

Small fonts mean more text can fit in the box.

You might be tempted to use the "auto" font size setting, but be warned,
this also makes short text entries very large, and makes the form look
weird.

### Enable the "Multi-line" option

Long fields, like full names and addresses, risk being longer than the
length of the field box.  If "Multi-line" is enabled, then long text will
wrap to a new line, instead of getting chopped.

### Set default properties for new fields

When you set a field to 6 points with multi-line, you should then
right-click it and choose "Use Current Properties as New Defaults".
Labeling PDFs is tedious; this will save you the trouble of setting
those options on every field.
