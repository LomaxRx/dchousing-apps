<h2>Field Name Dictionary</h2>

<p>
  PDFs used with District Housing must be labeled correctly, or the forms will not be filled.
  This guide is a dictionary of all the kinds of field names that are supported for form filling.
</p>

<h3>Basic personal information</h3>

<p>
  Here, we will list some basic fields you can fill in for the main
  applicant.
</p>

<%= render "table", field_name_descriptions: [
      [ "Name", "Full name" ],
      [ "FirstName", "First name"],
      [ "MiddleInitial", "Middle initial"],
      [ "MiddleName", "Middle name"],
      [ "LastName", "Last name"],
      [ "SSN", "Social security number"],
      [ "DOB", "Date of birth"],
      [ "BirthState", "State of birth"],
      [ "BirthCity", "City of birth"],
      [ "Nationality", "Nationality/citizenship"],
      [ "Gender", "The person's gender"],
      [ "GenderInitial", "First letter of gender"],
      [ "Mail", "Applicant's mailing address"],
      [ "Phone", "Applicant's phone number"],
      [ "HomePhone", "Applicant's home phone number"],
      [ "WorkPhone", "Applicant's work phone number"],
      [ "CellPhone", "Applicant's cell phone number"],
      [ "Email", "Applicant's e-mail address"],
      [ "Address", "Applicant's current residential address"],
      [ "MaritalStatus", "Applicant's marital status (Single, Married, Divorced, Widowed)"],
      [ "Occupation", "Applicant's occupation"],
] %>

  Personal field names can be prefixed with certain patterns to change which person it refers to.
  For example, you can get personal information for the first household member with the
  <code>HH1</code> prefix, as this table shows:
</p>

<%= render "table", field_name_descriptions: [
      [ "HH1Name", "First household member's full name" ],
      [ "HH1Gender", "First household member's gender"],
      [ "HH1Mail", "First household member's mailing address"],
      [ "HH1Phone", "First household member's phone number"],
      [ "HH1Email", "First household member's e-mail address"],
      [ "HH1Address", "First household member's current residential address"],
      [ "HH1Occupation", "First household member's occupation"],
] %>

<p>Increment the prefix number to select the next person of that type:</p>

<%= render "table", field_name_descriptions: [
      [ "HH1Name", "First household member's full name" ],
      [ "HH2Name", "Second household member's full name" ],
      [ "HH3Name", "Third household member's full name" ],
] %>

<p>
  Addresses can be suffixed with address components to get just that part of the address.  For example:
</p>

<%= render "table", field_name_descriptions: [
      [ "Address", "Full address" ],
      [ "AddressStreet", "Street address" ],
      [ "AddressCity", "City" ],
      [ "AddressState", "State" ],
      [ "AddressZip", "Zip code" ],
      [ "AddressApt", "Apartment" ],
      [ "Mail", "Mailing full address" ],
      [ "MailStreet", "Mailing street address" ],
      [ "MailCity", "Mailing city" ],
      [ "MailState", "Mailing state" ],
      [ "MailZip", "Mailing zip code" ],
      [ "MailApt", "Mailing apartment" ],
] %>
