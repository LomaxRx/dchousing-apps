The DC Housing Application Assistant aids DC residents and case workers apply for Section 8 housing by empowering them to automatically fill out multiple Section 8 housing applications using information collected via an online form.  Data collected once for a person can be used to populate PDF versions of housing applications.

This application uses the [pdf-forms gem](https://github.com/jkraemer/pdf-forms) and [pdftk](https://github.com/jkraemer/pdf-forms).
